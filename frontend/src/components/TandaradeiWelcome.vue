        <h2>How It Works:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Weâ€™ve shortlisted some beautiful names for our baby. Your challenge is to guess the one weâ€™ve chosen as first name.</li>
            <li>Place your votes â€” each guess is CHF 10, and you can cast as many votes as you like to increase your chances of winning - but only once!</li>
            <li>Every single Franken raised will go into a fund for our babyâ€™s future, making each guess a gift to our child.</li>
            <li>Get it right, and youâ€™re in for a treatâ€”a delicious three-course meal prepared by us!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Important Rules:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Make your choice carefully; once your vote is cast and the payment is made through Twint, PayPal, or Revolut, there's no changing it.</li>
            <li>Once you have voted, you will be able to see the overall top 3 votes.</li>
        </ul>
